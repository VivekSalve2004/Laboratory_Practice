  - `astar.cpp`: Implementation of the A* search algorithm for optimal pathfinding.
- **Greedy Strategies:**
  - `kruskal.cpp`: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction.
  - `jobscheduling.cpp`: Optimized job sequencing based on deadlines and profits.
  - `selectionsort.cpp`: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- **Backtracking:**
  - `assg4nqueens.cpp`: Recursive solution to the N-Queens constraint satisfaction problem.
- **Expert Systems & NLP:**
  - `expertsystem.py`: A logic-based system for decision making.
  - `chatbot.py`: A rule-based conversational agent.
  - `LibraryExpert.py` & `SocietyExpert.py`: Domain-specific expert systems for automation.

### ☁️ Cloud Computing & Apex
- **Apex Programming:** Located in the `/Apex Programming` directory, focusing on Salesforce-specific development and business logic automation.
